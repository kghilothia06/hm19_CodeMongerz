IDEA:
A prescription is an instruction written by a
medical professional that authorizes a patient to
be issued with a medicine or a treatment.
According to a study every year 7000 people die
due to wrongful medication. MedEx, a web
application enables a user and the pharmacist to
easily understand the prescription. With MedEx,
cases of misinterpretation of medicine names can
be decreased. MedEx not only provides the names
of medicines but also information like price, type 
and even substitute of that medicine
